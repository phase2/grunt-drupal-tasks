## Will you be switching to Gulp or another Task Runner?

Gulp's significant advantage of Grunt is it's ability to easily pipeline a
single set of files through multiple operations. That is not a common element of
this project, so a port to Gulp is not planned. If you have a compelling
argument and the time for significant contributions, please open or join a
relevant issue.
